# Task Bud

## Description:
Task Bud is a web application that is meant to allow users to create new groups and 
within those groups be able create various tasks and add a schedule to those tasks.
This project is still a work in progress and is not meant to be used as a final product.
Currently what a user can do is, create an account, login, and then be able to navigate to
the groups page to create a new group. The user is able to create a new group by entering
a name that will be used to identify the group. Once they click the create button, the user is
then able to see the group they just created and all other groups that they have created. A user
can also delete a group by clicking the delete button. There is so much more that needs to be done
to make this project a full functioning application. My future plans for this project are to
be able to implement the functionality to add tasks to a group, and to add a schedule to a task. I
would like to also make sure a group/task/schedule can be edited/deleted. I would also like to in the
oveview page on the user dashboard, be able to showcase all the groups a user has created, the 
completed tasks, and the tasks that are due to be completed. Also I would like to display the most
recent tasks that have been created, to which group they belong, and the status of the task. I also
would like to continue to fully develop the functionality of the user profile page. I would like to add the functionality for a user to edit their profile and be able to delete their account.

## Issues: 
There are some small issues with this project.One of the issues I had is if a user tries to create a 
group that already exists, there should be an alert to the user that the group already exists. The error
message shows in the console, however, this message to a non computer science person is not very
clear. This is one of the issues I wanted to correct, but am still working on fixing it.

Another small issue I had was when a user logs in and is directed to their dashboard, I wanted to
have a header that shows the name of the user. However, I was not able to get the name of the user to 
display in the header. This is a small little issue that I wanted to fix, but am still working on it.

Other than that, the project works, but it is just missing more funcionality that I will be workign on adding.
