This text file contains a short description about what I plan on doing for this project.


Idea:

My current idea is to create a task management web application. My end goal is to make a very simple 
(to-use) and optimal task management application. This task managemen application can be used by 
individual users to efficiently organize and prioritize tasks. Users can order their tasks however 
they please, be able to view progress on projects they have implemented, be notified on due dates 
or missed dates, and be able to update any details regarding the project or task they have. Information
will be stored in a database that way I can keep track of all the tasks and projects a user may have. 
A user will also be able to add tasks ahead of the current day/week/month. My goal is to help the user
improve their productivity and decrease stress by creating an application that can help them keep track
of various projects, duties, and tasks. My goal is for this application to help users of all ages and who have
various types of responsibilites, tasks, and projects. My biggest goal is to keep this application simple to
use, but to handle any kind of task or project a user may throw at it.
